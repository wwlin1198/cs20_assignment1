    <p><strong>Name one advantage to using github and one advantage to using the cpanel hosting.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>One advantage of using github is that the website is easily able to be modified from my 
            favorite text editor/IDE and pushed into github so it will automatically change the webpage
            so I can easily see how the change affected my website.</li>
        <li>One advantage of using cpanel hosting is that it will be easier to figure out any issues when they occur more
            easily as it gives more data about the website.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Which of the types of hosting do you prefer and why?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I prefer github pages because I can easily share and record my html website and I am most comfortable using github so it is easy for me to get 
            the website set up. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> The most satisfying part of this assignment is that we can do as much and get as creative as we want. I am most proud of the fact that I was able to sucessfully make
             my own website although it is a little bit plain. I do hope to improve more. In addition, I don't have to worry about memory leaks!
        </li>
    </ul>
